# Evaluation criteria 

### up to 6
no complete metaheuristic
- [ ] (only) key formulae were coded
- [ ] input data are prepared for the metaheuristic

### up to 8
the metaheuristic is implemented and works on at least 1 (one) example from the paper: 
- [ ] agents (individuals) are defined as classes/objects
- [ ] agents move
- [ ] agents evaluate solutions
- [ ] iterations are made until the stopping conditions are met

If (only if) the paper does not provide any math functions to try, you can generate synthetic data. You can avoid implementing any speed, quality, or any other optimizations that are proposed in the paper if there are any, just focus on the basic approach

### up to 10
in addition to the mark 8
- [ ] the metaheuristic must be proved to work on real-world input data and solve a real-world application of this metaheuristic from some domain (computer science, engineering, mathematics, energy, bioinformatics, economics, social sciences, physics, astronomy, chemistry, ecology, and so on). 
- [ ] how the problem you selected is reduced to the metaheuristic you implemented (how it can be solved by this metaheuristic) and what is the main idea of solving the problem with the selected metaheuristic
- [ ] do the mathematical problem statement in the PowerPoint slides and provide output/input examples with explanations

Important: the problem statement must be taken from another paper (possibly that cites the paper with your metaheuristic); not the paper that describes your metaheuristic. The application selected must not be solved in the paper that describes your metaheuristic. 


# Video demo
7-minute video demonstration published on YouTube

### contains
- [ ] how your code is structured
- [ ] how input/output data look like
- [ ] what does your software generates during the execution
- [ ] how to configure it
- [ ] how to deploy your application. 

### also
- [ ] presentation named **rizoeva_hw1.pptx**
- [ ] demonstrate in the demo video and in your code that your implementation works as expected in the paper
- [ ] demo video must clearly prove that your solution satisfies the evaluation criteria stated above
